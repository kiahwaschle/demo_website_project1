									<h3>MGM Cyber Attack</h3>
									<p>One of my favorite parts of cyber security is staying up to date on new cyber security information, and part of that is spreading that info to my friends and family. I love being educated on current cyber threats to keep my friends and family up to date, like explaining to them that the recent MGM attack was entirely made possible by social engineering. According to vx-underground, “All ALPHV ransomware group did to compromise MGM Resorts was hop on LinkedIn, find an employee, then call the Help Desk. A company valued at $33,900,000,000 was defeated by a 10-minute conversation.” My family was amazed by this! Such a huge company taken captive by some 20 year olds that did some linked-in sleuthing and then called the help desk… who ended up making $30 million off of them. I explained to them that humans are typically the weakest link when it comes to cyber security, that social engineering is the most popular avenue of attack that malicious actors take.</p>
