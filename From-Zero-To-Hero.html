									<h3>Getting into Cybersecurity as a Complete Noob</h3>
									<p>Whenever I first got into cyber security, it wasn’t even of my own accord. My mom had actually signed up for a cyber security bootcamp course and I just so happened to be over at her house when she was on her laptop taking the preliminary assessment test that the program uses to judge your current knowledge in the field. I was curious about what she was doing, reading the questions over her shoulder, and as a 50-something year old healthcare administrator, she really only knew the basics of technology. Thus, she was having trouble with some of the questions and I began to answer them over her shoulder. I had taken and passed a couple computer classes in high school, but those were my only credentials aside from growing up in Gen Z and using the internet for the first time when my age was still in the single digits. My mom was surprised by what I knew, no matter how basic, and said “Well shoot, maybe you ought to take this course too! We can do it together!”
Before that sentence, cyber security had only briefly crossed my mind, and never as a real career option. At the time I didn’t even own a laptop, my mom had me take the test and when I got a phone call saying I’d be a great match for the program, we ordered one… and boom, here I am. Halfway through this ASU cybersecurity bootcamp, set to test for the CompTIA Sec+ at the end of the year, set to completely change my career path and subsequently my life (and funnily enough, she ended up not even taking this bootcamp- I’m in it alone!).</p>
